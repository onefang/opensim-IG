# manage the OpenSim process for Your Sim
#
# usage:
#     monit start your_sim
#     monit stop your_sim
#     monit restart your_sim
#
# see 'daemon' setting in /etc/monit/monitrc for the cycle length.
# on ubuntu/debian, this is overridden by the CHECK_INTERVALS var in
# /etc/default/monit .  the below assumes you've set it to 30 seconds.
#
# if process dies, will restart sim within 30 seconds.  if process
# dies 5 times in as many tries, will stop trying and send email
# alert.
#
# if SimFPS drops to 0 for 2 minutes, restart.
#
# if process CPU usage stays above 300% for 2 minutes, restart.
#
# see ../README for configuration instructions.
#
# Hmmmm, seems that monit changing to a user and running bash -l is different from sudo changing to a user and running bash -l.
