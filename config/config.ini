; * The Const section allows us to define some basic information that we
; * will use throughout our configuration. We will provide examples for 
; * setting the base url of the Robust server and the public and private ports
; * it uses. Changing the values of the constants will set the operating
; * parameters thoughout the configuration. Other constants that may prove
; * to be useful may be added to the followin section. They may be 
; * referenced anywhere in the configuration by using ${Const|Name}. One
; * such use is providing a base path for setting locations that Robust
; * uses to write data.
