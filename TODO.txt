FIX BUGS -

Zarro boogs!


NEW FEATURES -

In [Startup] there is this -
    ; To run a script every few minutes, set the script filename here
    ; timer_Script = "filename"
Could do things with that perhaps.


In [Startup] there is this -
    ; Simulator Stats URI
    ; Enable JSON simulator data by setting a URI name (case sensitive)
    ; Stats_URI = "jsonSimStats"
